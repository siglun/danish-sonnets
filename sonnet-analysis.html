	analysis of text length, strophe structure and number of syllables
	per line. It also makes a simple content analysis based on

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>If there are any sonnets, do they rhyme and what are they about?</p>

        <p>I have since many years been a great fan of <a href="#kennethchurch">Kenneth Ward Church's</a> tutorial
        <em>Unix™ for Poets</em>. This is an investigation of
        what can be done with a corpus of literary text with very
        simple tools similar to the ones described by Church in his
        tutorial.</p>

        <p>I do not claim that there is anything novel or even significant in
        this text. Being a scientist, I think like a scientist and don't
        expect any deep literary theory here.</p>
      
      
        <h2>Finding poems</h2>

        <p>The ADL text corpus contains <a href="#adlcorpus">literary texts</a>. Since the texts are
        encoded according to the <a href="#teiguidelines">TEI
        guidelines</a> it is easy to find poetry in those
        files. Typically a piece of poetry is encoded as [lines within
        line
        groups](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-lg.html). More
        often than not the line groups are embedded in &lt;div&gt;
        ... &lt;/div&gt; elements.</p>

        <p>A poem may look like this in the source</p>

        <p>
          <p id=""><span class="biblAuthor">Michaëlis, Sophus</span>,
      1883.
      Jeg elsker —”,. In: <em>Solblomster</em>. <br/><small>Titelvignet af Frode Eskesen, Gyldendal, 1893, s. 151. Onlineudgave fra Arkiv for Dansk Litteratur.</small><br/></p>
        </p>

        <p>The default name space is declared as
        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", which we in following refer to
        with the namespace prefix 't'.</p>

        <p>The poem comprises four line groups with four, four, three and three
        lines. That is a very common strophe structure for
        [sonnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet), at least in
        Scandinavia. It is not always like that, but they all contain 14
        lines.</p>

        <p>Shakespeare wrote often his 14 lines typographically in one strophe,
        whereas Francesco Petrarca wrote them in two strophes with eight and
        six lines, respectively.</p>

        <p>To be more precise, a sonnet has one more characteristics than having 14 lines,
        the lines should be in [iambic pentameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iambic_pentameter).</p>
      

      
        <h2>Finding sonnets</h2>

        <p>You can easily find all poems based on a XPATH query like:</p>

        <pre> 
        //t:div[t:lg and @decls]
        
        </pre>

        <p>We can use that query in XSLT like this:</p>

        <pre> 
        &lt;xsl:for-each select="//t:div[t:lg and @decls]"&gt;
        &lt;xsl:if test="count(.//t:lg/t:l)=14"&gt;
        
        </pre>

        <p>So we iterate over all &lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;s having line
        groups inside and have a `@decls` attribute containing a
        reference to metadata in the TEI header. The latter is not
        universal, but we use it in ADL and that attribute is only
        set on pieces that a cataloger has designated as a _work_. I
        have implemented this using a [shell
        script](find_sonnet_candidates.sh) and [a
        transform](sonnet_candidate.xsl). Finally, we don't do
        anything unless there are 14 lines of poetry.</p>

        <p>The transform creates [a long table with data](sonnet_candidates.xml) on the sonnet candidates it finds.</p>
      

      
        <h2>Approximately pentametric</h2>

        <p>Finding &lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;s having 14 lines of poetry isn't good
        enough. We are expecting iambic pentameter, don't we? To actually analyse
        the texts for their rythmical properties is beyond me, but we could
        make an approximation.</p>

        <p>Iambic verse consists of feet with two syllables, i.e. if there are
        five feet per line we could say that iambic verse has approximately 10
        vowels per line. It is an approximation since a iamb should have the
        stress on the second syllable (due to ignorance I ignore the musical
        aspect of this; we will include false positives since lines of poetry
        with five feet must not be *iambic*).</p>

        <p>Any way, this script calculates the average number of vowels per line in poems with 14 lines:</p>

        <pre> 
        &lt;xsl:variable name="vowel_numbers" as="xs:integer *"&gt;
        &lt;xsl:for-each select=".//t:lg/t:l"&gt;
        &lt;xsl:variable name="vowels"&gt;
        &lt;xsl:value-of select="replace(.,'[^iyeæøauoå]','')"/&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;
        &lt;xsl:value-of select="string-length($vowels)"/&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;
        &lt;xsl:value-of select="format-number(sum($vowel_numbers) div 14, '#.####')"/&gt;
        
        </pre>

        <p>
          We use the replace function and a regular expression to remove
          everything in each line except the vowels. Then we measure the string
          length which should equal the number of vowels per line and add them
          together for all lines in the poem. Finally we divide that sum with 14
        and get the average number of vowels per line.</p>

        <p>For a sonnet it would be about 10, [or occasionally a little
        more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendecasyllable). In the Michaëlis poem
        quoted above it is 10.4.</p>

      

      

        <h2>Strophe structure</h2>

        <p>You can write a lot of nice poetry with 14 lines. Like Gustaf
        Munch-Petersen's [en borgers
        livshymne](https://tekster.kb.dk/text/adl-texts-munp1-shoot-workid62017)
        with one strophe with one line, then three strophes with four lines
        and finally a single line. The number of syllables per line seem to
        decrease towards the end. Gustaf was a modernist. There are no fixed
        structures and very few rhymes i his poetry.</p>

        <p>You can easily find out the strophe structure for each poem:</p>


        <pre> 
        &lt;xsl:variable name="lines_per_strophe" as="xs:integer *"&gt;
        &lt;xsl:for-each select=".//t:lg[t:l]"&gt;
        &lt;xsl:value-of select="count(t:l)"/&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;
        &lt;xsl:value-of select="$lines_per_strophe"/&gt;
        
        </pre>


        <p>That is, iterate over the line groups in a poem, and count the lines
        in each of them.</p>

        <p>I have summarized these data about all poems in ADL with 14
        lines. There are 243 of them (there are more, but they may have erroneous
        markup).</p>

        <p>You find these sonnet candidates in a table here
        [sonnet_candidates.xml](sonnet_candidates.xml). Find an extract below.</p>

        <p>Sophus Claussen's first poem may or may not be a sonnet,
        Brorson's poem is not. All of those with strophe structure 4
        4 3 3 are definitely sonnets, as implied by strophe
        structure and the "approximately pentametric" number of
        vowels per line (and, by the way, Aarestrup often points out
        that he is actually writing sonnets in text or titles).</p>
      

      

        <h2>Then we have the rhymes</h2>

        <p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, says Shakespeare. I believe that
        he is right. Then, however, I would like to add that the rhymes and
        meters of poetry (like the pentameter) is in the ear of listener. It
        is time consuming to read houndreds of poems aloud and figure out the
        rhyme structure. So an approximate idea of the rhymes could be have
        comparing the verse line endings.</p>

        <p>This is error prone, though. [Consider this sonnet by
        P.M. Møller](https://tekster.kb.dk/text/adl-texts-moeller01val-shoot-workid62307).</p>

        <div id="">

          <p><small>SONET</small></p>

          
            Den Svend, som Tabet af sin elskte frister,
            Vildfremmed vanker om blandt Jordens Hytter;
            Med Haab han efter Kirkeklokken lytter,
            Som lover ham igen, hvad her han mister.
          

          
            Men næppe han med en usalig bytter,
            Hvis Hjerte, stedse koldt for Elskov, brister,
            Som sig uelsket gennem Livet lister,
          Hans Armod kun mod Tabet ham beskytter.

          
            Til Livets Gaade rent han savner Nøglen,
            Hver Livets Blomst i Hjærtets Vinter fryser,
            Han gaar omkring med underlige Fagter.
          

          
            Ræd, Spøgelser han ser, naar Solen lyser,
            Modløs og syg, foragtet han foragter
            Det skønne Liv som tom og ussel Gøglen.
          
        </div>

        <p>The the last syllable of the eight first lines are the same '-ter'. If
        you use some script to compare the endings you'll only find single
        syllable rhymes and miss double syllable ones rhymes. I.e., you can
        erroneously categorize feminine rhymes (with two syllables) as
        masculine ones (with one syllable). (Sorry, I don't know the
        politically correct vocabulary for these concepts.)</p>

        <p>In order to understand what we hear when reading, we have to consider
        '-ister' and '-ytter'. I.e., it starts with rhyme structure 'abbabaab'
        not 'aaaaaaaa'. Furthermore, it continues 'cdedec'.</p>

        <p>I have written a set of scripts that traverse the
        [sonnet_candidates.xml](sonnet_candidates.xml) table. Transform that
        file using [iterate_the_rhyming.xsl](iterate_the_rhyming.xsl) selects
        poems with 14 lines and strophe structure 4 4 3 3. It generates a
        shell script which when executed pipes the content through other
        scripts that retrieve content, remove punctuation and finally detags
        them. The actual text is then piped through a perl script that
        analyse the endings according to the silly and flawed method described
        above.</p>

        <p>It works, sort of, until it doesn't. For poems with 4 4 3 3 strophe structure,  you can find the result in
        [rhymes_3chars.text](rhymes_3chars.text) and
        [rhymes_2chars.text](rhymes_2chars.text) for three and two letter rhymes, respectively. Run </p>

        <pre> 
        grep -P '^[a-q]{14}' rhymes_3chars.text   | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
        
        </pre>

        <p>to get a list of rhyme structure and their frequencies. The rhyme
        structures that occur more than twice are:</p>

        <pre>
        6 abbaabbacdecde
        5 abbaabbacdcdcd
        4 abcaadeafgghii
        4 abbaabbacdcede
        3 abcaadeafghgig
        
        </pre>

        <p>This silly algorithm does actually give two of the most common rhyme structure
        for sonnets, but misses a lot of order in the remaining chaos:</p>

        <pre>
        abbaabbacdcdcd
        
        </pre>

        <p>and</p>

        <pre>
        abbaabbacdecde
        
        </pre>

        <p>So while it may fail more often than it succeeds, the successes give
        results that are reasonable.</p>

        <p>The rhyme structure abbaabbacdecde is one is the most common ones found.
        Also it is one of the socalled Petrarchan rhyme schemes,
        [Cf. this](https://poetscollective.org/everysonnet/tag/abbaabbacdecde/).</p>

      

      

        <h2>What are the sonnets about?</h2>

        <p>Any piece of art is meant to be consumed by humans. Poems should
        ideally be understood when read aloud and listened to. By humans.</p>

        <p>The cliché says that art and literature is about what it means to be
        human. Could we therefore hypothesize that the sonnets address this
        from the point of view of dead Danish male poets who wrote sonnets
        some 100 – 200 years ago?</p>

        <p>Assume that, at least as a first approximation, the words chosen by
        poets mirror those subjects. For instance, if being human implies
        lethality, we could, on a statistical level hypothesize that words like
        "mourning", "grief", "death", "grave", etc appear in the sonnet corpus
        more than in a random sample of text. The opposites would also be
        expected: Concepts related to "love", "birth", "compassion" belong
        to the sphere of being human.</p>

        <p>I have detagged the poems with 14 lines and strophe structure 4 4 3 3,
        tokenized their texts and calculated the word frequencies. As a matter
        of fact, I've done that in two ways:</p>

        <p>(i) The first being doing a classical tokenization followed by 
        piping the stuff through</p>

        <pre> 
        sort | uniq -c | sort -n
        </pre>

        <p>such that I get a list of the 4781 Danish words that are used in our
        sonnet sample, sorted by their frequencies.</p>

        <p>(ii) The second way is the same, but I do it twice, once for each
        sonnet such that I get a list of words for each sonnet. Then I repeat
        that for the concatenated lists for all sonnets.</p>

        <p>This means that I get </p>

        <ul>
          <li>one list of word frequencies in the entire sample and </li>
          <li>a second list giving not of the number of occurences of each word, but the number of sonnets the word occurs in.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There are 160 sonnets in the selection, and the most
        frequent word occurs in all of them. These are the fifteen most
        commont word a measured by the [number of sonnets they occur
        in](poem_frequencies.text). Number of poems in the left column.</p>

        <p>and this is the list of the same thing, but measured as the grand
        total [occurrence of the words in the
        corpus](frequencies.text). Number of words in corpus in left column.</p>

        <p>As you can see this corroborates the established observation that the
        most frequent words in a corpus hardly ever describes the subject
        matter of texts (the words are conjunctions, pronouns,
        prepositions and the like). The distribution of the number of sonnets
        the words appear in:</p>

        <p>![Distribution](distro.png)</p>

        <p>There is just one word appearing in all 160 sonnets. It is 'og' meaning
        'and'. Then there are 3304 words occurring in just one sonnet. The
        [distribution.text](distribution.text) is generated from
        [poem_frequencies.text](poem_frequencies.text) using</p>

        <pre> 
        sed 's/\ [a-z]*$//' poem_frequencies.text | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -k 2 &gt; distribution.text
        </pre>

        <p>Column 1 is plotted against column 2.</p>

        <p>In this particular corpus, it seems that *aboutishness* start at words occuring in about
        25% of the sonnets, or less.</p>

        <p>As example we have death, dead and lethal etc in a number of
        sonnets. In the left column the number of sonnets containing the word.</p>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>

        <p>I think I could go on studying this for quite some time. However, I have to
        conclude this here, before the actual conclusions. There are
        interesting things to find here, though. Some of them are possible to study using simple methods, such as those described by Kenneth Ward Church in ["Unix for Poets"](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/kwc-unix-for-poets.pdf).</p>

        <p>The preliminary result from my armchair text processing exercise supports the
        notion that life was already in early modern Europe about sex, death
        and rock n'roll. Since rock wasn't there just yet, people had to be
        content with sonnets for the time being.</p>
